 Hi, I am Florence! You can also call me Flo. 
 I am a Software Engineer based in SF Bay area. Most recently, I co-created Layr: A decentralized p2p file storage network similar to Storj. 
 
 I love building awesome applications. When I am not coding, you will find me doing High Intensity Interval Training, pilates, playing with cats, or playing piano.
