title: More About me
---

 Hi, I am Florence! You can also call me Flo. 
 
 I am a Software Engineer based in the SF Bay area. Previosly, I worked in product management and data analysis. Most recently, I co-created Layr: A decentralized p2p file storage network. 
 
 When I am not coding, you will find me doing High Intensity Interval Training, pilates, playing with cats, or playing piano. 
 
 I also like tasting different kinds of tea. One of my favorites is Jasmine Pearl Green tea. Not only it helps bring refreshness by drinking it, it also helps relaxed and clam by smelling it. 
 
 I also write about technical articles to share my understandings toward specific topics, you can find out from <a href="https://medium.com/@florenceliang/">here</a>
