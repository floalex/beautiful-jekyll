 Hi, I am Florence! You can also call me Flo. 
 
 I am a Software Engineer based in SF Bay area, with 4 years experience in product management and data analysis. Most recently, I co-created Layr: A decentralized p2p file storage network. 
 
 I love building awesome applications. When I am not coding, you will find me doing High Intensity Interval Training, pilates, playing with cats, or playing piano. 
 
 I also write about technical articles to share my understandings toward specific topics, you can find out from <a href="https://medium.com/@florenceliang/">here</a>
